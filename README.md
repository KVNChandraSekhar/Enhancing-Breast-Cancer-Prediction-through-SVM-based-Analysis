# Enhancing-Breast-Cancer-Prediction-through-SVM-based-Analysis
The probability of effectively treating breast cancer can be significantly improved if it is detected at an early stage.In recent years, machine learning techniques, including SVM, have shown promising results in predicting breast cancer. These models analyze patient data and can predict the probability of developing breast cancer with a high degree of accuracy.To enhance the predictive power of our SVM-based breast cancer prediction model, we employed a technique called Grid Search.Our findings indicate that the proposed SVM model with Grid Search achieves highest accuracy rate.
